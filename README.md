# Cellular Automaton Simulation and Artiﬁcial Neural Network: A Way to Bring Dragon’s to Live
**(Honorable Mention in Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2019 by COMAP) **

A great story like Game of Thrones (GoT) oftentimes drown our mind into imagination land. Existence of mythical creature like dragon was felt so real that we start to dig deeper about how much they eat, sleep, how they interact with each other, and so forth. This may seems silly but in the 21st centuries, entertainment industry is taking their movie production more seriously. For example, Disney has created a mathematical model that can perfect the princess’s hair movement [1]. This is so the production house can create more realistic movie in the future. In order to do that, of course we have to imagine that we are part of the story and everything is real. In this paper we presented a computerized model for analyzing dragon’s characteristics such as behaviour, habits, diet, and its interaction with the environment. Our model takes simulation into consideration as a signiﬁcant determiner of Drogon, Rhegan and Viserion - Daenerys dragon’s daily life. Our simulation consider not only the movement, but also the weight and body width growth, the possibility of them ﬁghting each other, and the availability of food resources. The concept of Cellular Automaton, Gompertz function [3], and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks were used to support our model. There are seven section of this paper. In section 2, we describe our assumption that is being used to develop the model that will be explained in section 3. Sensitivity analysis, case conclusion
